## Project Vision and Objectives  
This Project is a basic portfolio website populated with dummy data. It is aimed at showing how to make a portfolio page, which can be improved by anyone to make a more concrete personal portfolio page and add features to suit them and further deploy it.

## Technologies Used
The project uses React as the main technology with a combination of HTML and Javascript. Since it is a basic static portfolio website it allows anyone else who
wishes to improve on it to do so and add more interesting features on top of the existing ones. React was chosen in particular because of my familiarity with it 
and its popularity as a web development technology right now. This means a wide range of users who wish to collaborate or work on this project can do so with ease.

One challenge I faced with the project was ensuring it is mobile friendly without having to re-do it from scratch, after I had finished with the web version. I hope I can add a few more features in the future, like the ability to link to external web pages so visitors can access my other projects and more.
